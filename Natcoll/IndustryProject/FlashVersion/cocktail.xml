<stella><br />This is a brief insight into this small business  unit and the history surrounding it.
With the privatisation of a number of government services following the user pays policies, came changes in legislation.
the Dangerous Goods Act was repealed and the new Hazardous Substances and New Organisms Act (HSNO) came into being.

Dangerous Goods Inspectors employed by OSH and Local Authorities disappeared and the new Test Certifier
regime took over. Test Certifiers are all private individuals (approved by (ERMA) the environmental risk management authority
the new body set up by the government to administer HSNO.

WHEN IT STARTED
HEF HSNO INSPECTION SERVICES was set up in June 2004  following approval from ERMA and the changes to the legislation, it is run by a ex
OSH EXPLOsives and dangerous goods inspector Harry Flannigan who retired from OSH to take up this new venture.

WHAT IT DOES
The company carries out the inspection of premises storing dangerous goods and advises client on the storage and handling
 requirements of the new legislation.When these requirements are met a certificate is issued to the client.
This certificate which is similar to the previous dangerous goods licence must be produced when requested by a OSH 
HSNO Enforcement Officer when visiting the premises.
